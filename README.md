Before committing, do the following:
* Run the game in the editor player.
* Run the exported game by clicking "File/Build and Run" or Ctrl+B.
  * The export build process might change some non-gitignored files. These changes are build artifacts that are mixed in with non-build-artifact files. This is a known issue. However, these changes should still be committed.
